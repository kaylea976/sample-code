# sample-code
code from college assignments for future reference
These files include code in various languages from different projects and assignments I had in college.
If you have any questions regarding what the assignment was feel free to ask/comment.


NOTE: some of these might not work for you since it was specific to my coding assignment and other files went with them to create one project
these are like snippets of the assignments. And of course the server and client files are there to show what I did for my TCP protocol and can help
others with theirs but you can not directly copy my code as it is specific to my server and IP that i was given for the assignment.
